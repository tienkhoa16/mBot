# mBot Project

mBot is a smart robot which can calibrate itself so that it can move in a straight line. Besides, mBot is able to detect the color above it to execute some preset movement (i.e. turn left, turn right, turn left continuously, turn right continuously, and uturn). When mBot finishes its given tasks, it will play _We Wish You a Merry Christmas_!
